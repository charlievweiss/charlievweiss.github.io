description: A project that has frustrated me to no end. I was inspired to make this after watching my bestie detangle a small box of necklaces for about two hours. The velcro necklace holder fixes that issue beautifully-- but I fear for the safety of the earrings without a stiff casing. She loves this bag and uses it all the time, but in my mind it is still a prototype.
