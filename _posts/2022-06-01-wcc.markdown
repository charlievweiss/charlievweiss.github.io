description: As a crew member in the Washington Conservation Corps (WCC), I restored native riparian and wetland ecosystems in King County, WA. I wrestled with Himalayan blackberry and English Ivy, personally planted over 4000 native trees, shrubs, and live stakes, and kept the team safe and healthy with daily safety talks.
