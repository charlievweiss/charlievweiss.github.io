description: I volunteered to travel and camp for 2.5 weeks with four other team members through the Alaskan wilderness to study primary forest succession. We relocted and documented the status of 50 plots in remote marine environments in Glacier Bay National Park, braving poor weather, biting insects, and bear country. I've never had so much fun!
