    <p> This is a video game I created for a class called Software Design. The goal was to use Python's Pygame library and an MVP (model-viewer-player) framework to create a fun experience for the player.</p>
    <p>
      It started off as a mini partner project with Diego Garcia which I then adapted into a final project. Together, we created and implemented the basics of a platformer where the player will tragically always lose. I took it further and added jumping, falling, obstacle collisions, and graphics to make it a more polished game. </p>
