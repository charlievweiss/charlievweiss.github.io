        <p>I am an aspiring wetland scientist with a background in robotics (particularly software). As I near the end of the University of Washington's Wetland Science and Management Certicate, I am eager to apply my knowledge of wetland soils, hydrology, vegetation, and law to a job in wetland delineation and permitting. One day I'd love to design and implement my own wetland restoration project, but I have a few years of career before I'm ready for that!</p>

        <p>The more I wade through the world of wetlands and learn about their place within our natural and urban landscapes, the more sure I am I made the right choice pivoting away from engineering. However, I am incredibly grateful for my past experiences, and frequently rely on my engineering background to understand technology, technical drawings, systems, and diverse stakeholder perspectives.</p>
